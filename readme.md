## Overview

### What is the project?
WD-Seatwork-2 is a web development project that involves designing five distinct hero sections within a multi-page website. It serves as a course activity to help students apply and demonstrate their knowledge of HTML and CSS in practical, creative layouts. Each hero section showcases a different design approach, reinforcing students' understanding of webpage structure and styling.

### What is the purpose?
The purpose of this project is to practice and strengthen students' skills in using HTML and CSS to create visually engaging and user-friendly website sections. It allows students to explore the principles of layout, styling, and web design, while also encouraging creativity in presenting introductory content through hero sections.

### What are the key components?

- A fully structured multi-page website

- 5 uniquely designed hero sections, each on separate pages

- A consistent and well-designed title page

- Thoughtful use of typography to enhance readability and visual hierarchy

- Integration of icons to support visual messaging

- Application of transitions and effects to improve interactivity

- Use of images and media to enhance visual impact

- Interactive buttons and links for navigation and user engagement

### What technologies are used and how are they used?
This project uses:

- HTML for structuring the content of each web page, including headings, images, text blocks, and navigation.

- CSS for styling the visual appearance of the site — including layout design, colors, fonts, transitions, responsiveness, and media presentation.


### Key Components
1. MultiPage Website - A website structured across multiple HTML pages (e.g., index.html, about.html, contact.html, etc.) instead of a single-page layout. Each page can have its own content, layout, and styling, providing a more organized experience and improving navigation.

2. 5 Hero Sections - Each page includes a hero section — the large, visually striking area at the top, often containing a background image, heading, and call-to-action. These serve as the attention-grabbers and set the tone for the content below. Having five ensures visual variety across your site.

3. Title Page - A dedicated landing or welcome page that introduces the website or project. It typically contains the main site title, a tagline or slogan, and links to other sections. This is the user's first impression and helps establish branding or context.

4. Typography - Refers to the selection and styling of fonts throughout the website. This includes headings, body text, and any readable content. Consistent typography improves readability, hierarchy, and visual aesthetics.

5. Icons - Scalable vector graphics (SVGs) or font icons (e.g., Font Awesome) are used for UI elements such as buttons, navigation, contact info, and feature highlights. They enhance user interaction and communicate meaning visually.

6. Transitions - Smooth animated effects triggered by user actions or page loads — like hovering over buttons, scrolling, or switching pages. These add a layer of interactivity and make the site feel more responsive and modern.

7. Images and Media - Includes static images, video backgrounds, embedded media (like YouTube or audio), and graphics. These visually support the content, create emotional impact, and help users better understand the message or brand.

8. Buttons and Links -Interactive elements allowing users to navigate between pages, submit forms, or trigger actions. Properly styled buttons and hyperlinks improve usability, encourage engagement, and guide user flow through the site.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
